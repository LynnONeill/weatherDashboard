Title: Weather Dashboard

Introduction: This project is a web-based application which utilizes Open Weather APIs to pull current weather conditions, a five day forcast, and UV index for any given US city.  As the user enters each city, the city is stored in local storage and can be selected again to pull that data.  The current date appears at the top of the page. The far left coloumn contains the labled hourly tags, the center coloumn allows for user input and each input area has its own save button to the right. 

Technology: This website utilizes html, css, bootstrap, jquery, Open Weather APIs, and javascript.

Launch: This website can be launched in a browser.

Project Status: This project is complete

I had assistance from my tutor: Mike Munoz on this project.
